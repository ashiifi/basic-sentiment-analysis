# basic-sentiment-analysis
Basic Sentiment Analysis Project

to run, use python.py file.

sentimentanalysis(s,t,u) takes in a txt file 's'. 
It processes the file, cleans it up,
breaks it into sentences line by line, then into words to compare to the other 
two files, 't' which is the positive words file, and 'u' which is the negative words file.
Then prints out how many times a Postive, Negative, and Neutral word was in the txt.
Neutral in this case is just any words that arent in the pos or neg files.
